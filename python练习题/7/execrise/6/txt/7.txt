When I was very small, I dreamed to be a princess and when I was in primary school, I dreamed to be a teacher, because I admired my teachers so much. My dream changes as I grow up. Now I am in high school, I want to be a fashion designer. I love fashion so much, when I see the models wearing the beautiful dresses on the stage, I am so envious. I wish I could design these dresses and create the fashion. I have been paying attention to the fashion for a long time, when I see the good style, I will keep them in my mind. When the idea occurs my mind, I will write it down and draw it in the picture. Now I have collected many pictures, they stand for my dream, I believe that someday I can make my clothes.
