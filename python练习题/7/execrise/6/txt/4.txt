Many years ago, as the development of technology, robot was created to facilitate people’s work. Robot can do many things for men, like it will accept the order and then carry out it. The most obvious advantage of robot is to caculate very quickly. As robot gets improved all the time, its functions have been largely expanded, most people worry that it will take the place of human brains. Many movies have explored this topic and they came to the conclusion that robot will not take the place of human being. One thing for sure is that men can’t compete with robot on caculating or the computer program, but robot has no feelings, it can’t be the real person. Even it looks like a man, still it is just the machine. It is the emotion that makes the difference between man and machine.
